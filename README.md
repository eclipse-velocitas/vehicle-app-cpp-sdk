The Vehicle App SDK for C++ allows to create `Vehicle Apps` from the [Velocitas](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/velocitas-docs) development model in the C++ programming language.

## Folder structure

* üìÅ `examples` - example vehicle apps showcasing the use of the SDK
    * üìÅ `seat-adjuster` - an example application showing how to adjust the driver seat when receiving MQTT messages
    * üìÅ `set-data-points` - an example application showing how to set single and multiple data points
    * üìÅ `vehicle_model` - a handwritten example model to be used by all examples
* üìÅ `sdk`
    * üìÅ `include` - the headers which need to be included by users of the SDK
    * üìÅ `src` - contains the source code for the SDK from which the SDK library is built
    * üìÅ `test` - contains the unit test code for the SDK

## Prerequisites

* Visual Studio Code with the Remote Containers extension
* Docker installation on the host

## Building

### Installing dependencies
Before a build can be started, all dependencies required by the SDK need to be installed. Issue the following command in the SDK root directory:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```

### Proxy Issues
If you are working behind a corporate proxy, the `install_dependcies.sh` (which is also called during devcontainer build!) might probably fail 
downloading 3rd party packages via https with a TLS/SSL certificate validation error (we actually saw this issue in the build of gRPC trying to
download the opencensus-proto package from storage.googleapis.com). 

Please have a look at our ["working behind proxy" tutorial](https://websites.eclipseprojects.io/velocitas/docs/tutorials/quickstart/behind_proxy/) 
to get hints how to possibly overcome this.

### Building the SDK
To build the SDK, run the build script:
```bash
./build.sh
```

## Starting the runtime

Open the `Run Task` view in VSCode and select `Local - Start VehicleApp runtime`.

## Launching the example
With the runtime running in the background, you can run the app.

### Without debugging

Open the `Run Task` view in VSCode and select `Local - VehicleApp (Dapr run)`.

### With debugging
You can simply launch the example in the Debugging Tab. Make sure the `VehicleApp - Debug (dapr run)` is selected at the top. After the selection is done, you can also simply hit `F5`, to start the debugging session. 

*Note: This launch task will also make sure to re-build the app if it has been modified!*

### Run App and Dapr-Sidecar as individual Docker containers
#### Sidecar
```bash
docker run --net="host" --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)"/.dapr,target=/.dapr daprio/daprd:edge ./daprd -app-id vehicleapp -dapr-grpc-port 50001 -dapr-http-port 3500 -components-path /.dapr/components -config /.dapr/config.yaml -app-protocol grpc
```
#### App
```bash
docker run --rm -it --net="host" -e DAPR_GRPC_PORT=50001 -e DAPR_HTTP_PORT=3500 localhost:12345/vehicleapp:local
```
